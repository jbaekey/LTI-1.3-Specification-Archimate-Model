# LTI-1.3-Specification-Archimate-Model
Modeling the LTI 1.3 specification in Archimate to enable application of specification within an architectural context.   

The specification model will provide an analytical tool that cannot be achieved using narrative text.  The audience for this is intended to be those who must integrate or establish integrations with systems suppprting the specifications.  Additional documents will need to be modeled that show implementations of the specirication for this to meet the needs of the intended audience.  Developers may use the model but it will not fulfill the majority of their needs.

Archimate is not intended to replace all modeling languages and notations.  While I may push that boundary here, be aware of this and move to more finer grained notations when appropriate.
